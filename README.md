# Comments:
- I created a custom function that appends a button to the resume header. An event listener detects the clicking of the button and slideToggles the image for a duration of 2 seconds.
- I used the clearfix method to correct an issue with floats in the education section of the resume
- My version of Atom reveals no issues at the time of submission.
- There are no errors visible in Google Dev Tools at the time of submission.
- Max-width of 100% was used to style img tags to ensure that all accent images in the sidebar and the logo collapse responsively, but this is not used as a media query.
